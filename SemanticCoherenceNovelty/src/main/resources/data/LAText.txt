Welcome to the World of Biodiversity Biodiversity is all around us. It is crucial to the quality of our lives and the lives of all other living organisms, but we actually know very little about who all the players are in this pageantry of life, much less the roles they play and the benefits they can and do provide. We do know, however, that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming and unprecedented rate, driven by our own actions that result in habitat loss, pollution, climate change, overfishing and overhunting, to name a few.

Which part of the text shows spheres interacting with each other? Tall mountains trap clouds, and when this happens the mountain will receive a lot of rain or snow until the cloud loses enough water to float over the top. The side of the mountain that traps the clouds is on the windward side, the side the wind pushes on. The other side of the mountain, leeward side, receives no wind and very little rain. The land at the bottom of the leeward side of the mountain is usually a desert, as a result of the rain shadow (gets little to no rain each year). The climate on each side of the mountain can be, and usually are, very different. <p>Which part of the text shows spheres interacting with each other?
