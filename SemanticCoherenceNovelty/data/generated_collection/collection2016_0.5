there relationship between moisture content when straight line provides reasonable summary the relationship between two numerical variables say thatthe two variables are linearly related that there linear relationship between the two variables take look the scatter plots below and answer the questions that follow there relationship between moisture content and frying time the data points look scattered there relationship between moisture content and frying time does the relationship look linear
--------------------------------------------------------------
there relationship between quality when straight line provides reasonable summary the relationship between two numerical variables say thatthe two variables are linearly related that there linear relationship between the two variables take look the scatter plots below and answer the questions that follow scatter plot shows data for the prices bike helmets and the quality ratings the helmets based scale thatestimates helmet quality there relationship between quality rating and price are the data points scattered there relationship between quality rating and price for bike helmets does the relationship appear linear
--------------------------------------------------------------
not every relationship linear when straight line provides reasonable summary the relationship between two numerical variables say thatthe two variables are linearly related that there linear relationship between the two variables take look the scatter plots below and answer the questions that follow there relationship between the number cell phone calls and age does look like the data points arescattered there relationship between the number cell phone calls and age does the relationship appear linear there relationship between moisture content and frying time the data points look scattered there relationship between moisture content and frying time does the relationship look linear scatter plot shows data for the prices bike helmets and the quality ratings the helmets based scale thatestimates helmet quality there relationship between quality rating and price are the data points scattered there relationship between quality rating and price for bike helmets does the relationship appear linear
--------------------------------------------------------------
answer the questions that follow when straight line provides reasonable summary the relationship between two numerical variables say thatthe two variables are linearly related that there linear relationship between the two variables take look the scatter plots below and answer the questions that follow there relationship between the number cell phone calls and age does look like the data points arescattered there relationship between the number cell phone calls and age does the relationship appear linear
--------------------------------------------------------------
consider the following scatter plot consider the following scatter plot for problems and there relationship between finish time and age are the data points scattered you think there relationship between finish time and age does look linear
--------------------------------------------------------------
answer for following question the relationship displayed scatter plot positive linear relationship does the value the variable tend toincrease decrease the value increases you were describe this relationship using line would the linehave positive negative slope the relationship displayed scatter plot negative linear relationship the value one the variablesincreases what happens the value the other variable you were describe this relationship using line would the line have positive negative slope what does mean say that there positive linear relationship between two variables what does mean say that there negative linear relationship between two variables
--------------------------------------------------------------
residuals one way think about how useful line for describing relationship between two variables use the line predict the values for the points the scatter plot
--------------------------------------------------------------
also common describe the strength also common describe the strength linear relationship would say that the linear relationship scatterplot weaker than the linear relationship scatter plot why you think the linear relationship scatter plot considered weaker than the linear relationship scatterplot
