7499585e-ae63-49f4-8f8d-24966c1170ab  Here is an elevation-versus-time graph       Here is an elevation-versus-time graph of a ball rolling down a ramp. The first section of the graph is slightly curved. a. From the time of about 1.7 sec. onward, the graph is a flat horizontal line. If Ken puts his foot on the ball at time 2 sec. to stop the ball from rolling, how will this graph of elevation versus time change? b. Estimate the number of inches of change in elevation of the ball from 0 sec. to 0.5 sec. Also estimate the change in elevation of the ball between 1.0 sec. and 1.5 sec. c. At what point is the speed of the ball the fastest, near the top of the ramp at the beginning of its journey or near the bottom of the ramp? How does your answer to part (b) support what you say?
