61a553e7-9b9b-4a8a-b39a-d2666e06a120  Autumn is starting a new club                       Autumn is starting a new club with eight members including herself. She wants everyone to have a secret identification code made up of only A’s and B’s, known as an ID code. For example, using two characters, her ID code could be AA.<br>a. Using A’s and B’s, can Autumn assign each club member a unique two-character ID code using only A’s and B’s? Justify your answer. Here’s what Autumn has so far.<br>b. Using A’s and B’s, how many characters would be needed to assign each club member a unique ID code? Justify your answer by showing the ID codes you would assign to each club member by completing the table above (adjust Autumn’s ID if needed).<br><br>
11fe79e5-9d10-42be-9827-320eb60aa015  When the club grew to 𝟏𝟔 members                    Autumn is starting a new club with eight members including herself. She wants everyone to have a secret identification code made up of only A’s and B’s. For example, using two characters, her ID code could be AA. <br>When the club grew to 𝟏𝟔 members, Autumn started noticing a pattern. Using A’s and B’s:<br> i. Two people could be given a secret ID code with 𝟏 letter: A and B. <br>ii. Four people could be given a secret ID code with 𝟐 letters: AA, BA, AB, BB. <br>iii. Eight people could be given a secret ID code with 𝟑 letters: AAA, BAA, ABA, BBA, AAB, BAB, ABB, BBB. <br>a. Complete the following statement, and list the secret ID codes for the 𝟏𝟔 people. 𝟏𝟔 people could be given a secret ID code with _________ letters using A’s and B’s<br>b. Describe the pattern in words. What type of function could be used to model this pattern?<br><br><br><br>

d1e441ee-b535-4836-95c2-ecf69a38fabf  How many digits would be needed so that each phone  There are many more telephones than the number of people in the United States because of people having home phones, cell phones, business phones, fax numbers, etc. Assuming we need at most 𝟏𝟎 billion phone numbers in the United States, how many digits would be needed so that each phone number is unique? Is this reasonable? Explain.
f3f8659f-eb32-4b7f-a159-13efcfb5cf74  How many clubs can be assigned a unique ID code     The student body president needs to assign each officially sanctioned club on campus a unique ID code for purposes of tracking expenses and activities. She decides to use the letters A, B, and C to create a unique three-character code for each club.<br>a. How many clubs can be assigned a unique ID code according to this proposal? <br>b. There are actually over 𝟓𝟎𝟎 clubs on campus. Assuming the student body president still wants to use the letters A, B, and C, how many characters would be needed to generate a unique ID code for each club? <br><br>
c13003cd-f934-4d8f-81f0-1142c408da88  Assign a unique ID code                             Can you use the numbers 𝟏, 𝟐, 𝟑, and 𝟒 in a combination of four digits to assign a unique ID code to each of 𝟓𝟎𝟎 people? Explain your reasoning. 
f2bed33b-de9e-457d-9392-6a5475ad4dba  How many cars could be registered to this county?   Automobile license plates typically have a combination of letters (𝟐𝟔) and numbers (𝟏𝟎). Over time, the state of New York has used different criteria to assign vehicle license plate numbers. <br>a. From 1973 to 1986, the state used a 𝟑-letter and 𝟒-number code where the three letters indicated the county where the vehicle was registered. Essex County had 𝟏𝟑 different 𝟑-letter codes in use. How many cars could be registered to this county?<br>b. Since 2001, the state has used a 𝟑-letter and 𝟒-number code but no longer assigns letters by county. Is this coding scheme enough to register 𝟏𝟎 million vehicles? 
0c11edfd-5f52-4b4f-b077-ac46c396306e  How many times stronger                             The Richter scale uses base 𝟏𝟎 logarithms to assign a magnitude to an earthquake based on the amount of force released at the earthquake’s source as measured by seismographs in various locations. <br>a. Explain the difference between an earthquake that is assigned a magnitude of 𝟓 versus one assigned a magnitude of 𝟕.<br>b. An earthquake with magnitude 𝟐 can usually only be felt by people located near the earthquake’s origin, called its epicenter. The strongest earthquake on record occurred in Chile in 1960 with magnitude 𝟗. 𝟓. How many times stronger is the force of an earthquake with magnitude 𝟗. 𝟓 than the force of an earthquake with magnitude 𝟐?<br>c. What is the magnitude of an earthquake whose force is 𝟏, 𝟎𝟎𝟎 times greater than a magnitude 𝟒. 𝟑 quake?
f269ad2d-e5f0-402e-bdcc-d4e21b0247dd  Explain why this formula would assign 𝟎             Sound pressure level is measured in decibels (dB) according to the formula 𝑳 = 𝟏𝟎 𝐥𝐨𝐠 (<span class="gru-math-expression" contenteditable="false"><span class="gru-math-expression"><span class="source" hidden="">\frac{I}{I_o}</span>$$\frac{I}{I_o}$$</span></span>), where 𝑰 is the intensity of the sound and 𝑰<sub>﻿o</sub> is a reference intensity that corresponds to a barely perceptible sound. <br>a. Explain why this formula would assign 𝟎 decibels to a barely perceptible sound.<br>b. Decibel levels above 𝟏𝟐𝟎 𝐝𝐁 can be painful to humans. What would be the intensity that corresponds to this level?
